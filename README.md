## Using `mern-infrastructure` to Create MERN-Stack Projects in the Future

Here's the process to create a new MERN-Stack project that starts with the infrastructure code:

1. Clone the **mern-infrastructure** repo: `git clone <url of mern-infrastructure> <name-of-project>`
    > Note that the folder created will be same as `<name-of-project>` instead of mern-infrastructure

2. `cd <name-of-project>`

3. Install the Node modules:  `npm i`

4. Create a .env (`touch .env`) and add entries for `DATABASE_URL` and `SECRET`

5. Update the `"name": "mern-infrastructure"` in **package.json** to the name of your project.

6. Create a new repo on your personal GH account.

7. Copy the new GH repo's URL.

8. Update the remote's URL: `git remote set-url origin <paste the copied GH url>`

9. Make the initial commit:  `git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit"`

10. Push for the first time:  `git push -u origin main`

11. Have fun coding your new project and don't forget to make frequent commits!

#### Congrats!# MERN-Infrastructure
